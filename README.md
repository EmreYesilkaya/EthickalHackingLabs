## Lab 2: Attack Analysis

**Description:**  
This lab involves analyzing a compromised website to identify the attack vector and determine the exploited vulnerabilities.

**Tools Used:**  
- Wireshark
- Tcpdump
- Various network analysis tools

**Goals:**  
- Identify the IP address and service details of the compromised site.
- Determine the operating system and content management system used.
- Analyze network traffic to identify malicious activities.

## Lab 3: Malware Activity Analysis

**Description:**  
This lab focuses on analyzing a memory dump to identify malware activity and understand its impact on the system.

**Tools Used:**  
- Volatility
- Various memory analysis tools

**Goals:**  
- Identify the exact date and time of the memory dump.

## Lab 4: Metadata and Vulnerabilities

**Description:**  
This lab involves scanning a network to identify running services and their versions, finding vulnerabilities, and exploiting them.

**Tools Used:**  
- Nmap
- Nessus
- Metasploit
- Kali Linux (optional)

**Goals:**  
- Identify services running on the network and their versions.
- Find and exploit vulnerabilities in the identified services.
- Document and demonstrate at least two exploited vulnerabilities.
